- ⚠️ (required): I as a user can create to-do items, such as a grocery list.
- ⚠️ (required): I as another user can collaborate in real-time with user - so that we
  can (for example) edit our family shopping-list together.
- I as a user can mark to-do items as “done” - so that I can avoid clutter and focus on
  things that are still pending.
- (not yet) I as a user can filter the to-do list and view items that were marked as done - so that I
  can retrospect on my prior progress.
- I as a user can create multiple to-do lists where each list has its unique URL that I
  can share with my friends - so that I could have separate to-do lists for my groceries
  and work related tasks.
