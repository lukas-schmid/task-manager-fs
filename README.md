## Introduction

You can create boards. E.g. for groceries or for work related tasks. The URL of the board can be shared with other users.
When another user opens the board URL, everyone on this board can work together on the tasks.

Inside a board you can change the name of the board or delete the board on the top navbar
You can create multiple columns. E.g. A column for "to do", "in progress" and "done"
Each column can create task.
Clicking on a task let's you add a description, change title, move to another column by selecting the column on the top dropdown
or just delete the task again

## Requirements and user stories

- ⚠️ (required): I as a user can create to-do items, such as a grocery list.
- ⚠️ (required): I as another user can collaborate in real-time with user - so that we
  can (for example) edit our family shopping-list together.
- I as a user can mark to-do items as “done” - so that I can avoid clutter and focus on
  things that are still pending.
- I as a user can create multiple to-do lists where each list has its unique URL that I
  can share with my friends - so that I could have separate to-do lists for my groceries
  and work related tasks.
